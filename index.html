              Hi there! My name is Kenneth Lai but you probably know that since you're visiting my site.
              I grew up in San Leandro, California but nowadays I'm excited for my upcoming move to Southern
              California for College. I completed an Associates Degree in Business but I'm looking to get into
              tech. I started my Computer Science journey about two years ago and have been fascinated ever since.
              I was fascinated by the way we can use the myriad of tools available to us to create practical products
              using code. I even created this site! Below are my contact information, social media and portfolio projects.
              Thanks for visiting!
            </p>
